                         Emacs Club this Week
                         ====================


Commands of the Week 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  C-x 2 - Split screen in two horizontally
  C-x 3 - Split screen in two vertically

  You can run these commands ad infinitum within any window. To close
  some of them: 

  C-x 0 - Close current window (the one with my cursor in it)
  C-x 1 - Close all other windows but the current window.

  If you are working on emacs in terminal, remember you can't click
  into windows, so to change between them use

  C-x o (That's the letter Oh)

Next Session (Beginner Level) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The next meeting will be on Tuesday Feb 14 at 6pm in Levine 307. 

  If you are already an Emacs pro, you can afford to skip this
  session, however, you will almost certainly learn a few new
  things if you make it. 

  We'll go through Emacs basics, most of which will already be
  contained within the tutorials. This will be a great time for you to
  ask questions about general emacs concepts that don't make sense to
  you yet, as well as asking about certain features you want to know how
  to use (Emacs can do everything, remember). We'll also explain
  specific topics and concepts that are usually confusing to
  beginners, and introduce certain features that are desirable and not
  necessarily covered by the tutorial. 
  
  I highly recommend at least skimming the Emacs tutorial, or this one
  [http://www.cs.iupui.edu/~aharris/emchap/EmacsGuide.html] which is
  very good. This is the BEST way to learn the basics. 

  Remember to bring your laptops so you can follow along. We'll have a
  projector this time and more pizza :)
