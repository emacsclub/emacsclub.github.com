Meeting Notes 2012-01-19

* Dinner before business
  As the Dining Philosophers have decided to terminate our dinner
  funding, we are forced to bring our own food. 
* Bars, Garbage Chutes, and Tap House
* The Emacs Club Dotfiles Party
  - Next Tuesday. 
  - We need a venue. All the usual rooms are unavailable.
  - The discussion immediately switches to bars again. And which bar could
    host Emacs Club. They would need to have a projector. 
  - We decide to postpone to the week after. 
* Dotfiles Party Planning
  - Levine 307, April 16th
* The Content
  - What are dotfiles? 
  - Symlinking dotfiles to a git repo. 
  - ssh executing a check on your dotfiles before logging you to your
    machine.
  - Zach is opposed to adding more indirection to managing
    dotfiles. 
  - *Zach* : These kids don't understand what these things are that
    they're using.
  - We want the vim club kids to join this. They tried to start
    something but couldn't get out of movement mode. 
* Matt's Meeting Notes
  - Where's Matt Croop? We miss his meeting notes.
* Soy Foam
  - *Zach* : The foam after shaking a packet of soy sauce is gross.
  - Zach is able to halt all conversation by displaying more soy foam.
* The Basics
