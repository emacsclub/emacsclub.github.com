                         Emacs Club this Week
                         ====================

Greetings all. We didn't have such a great turnout to the intro emacs
session last week, so we will most likely be merging the two (advanced
and beginner) sessions into one. Don't feel discouraged to attend any
of our sessions if you are still a beginner. It is the best way for
anyone to learn more about Emacs. On with the show!

 Command of the Week 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  M-g g : which executes goto-line
  
  You can also execute it with M-x goto-line.

 Next Session 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  Today's meeting will be in Skirkanich 508. We'll go over our topic
  list and decide what we want to go through as a group. 
  
  Other topics: 
    - Tramp: Zach will show us how to edit files over ssh without
      needing a shell
    - Club website: Automating org export for larger sites.
