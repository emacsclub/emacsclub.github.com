Attention Hackers!

Is Eclipse slowing down your laptop? Have you reached the limits of Notepad++? Can you contort your fingers in gruesome positions? If so, perhaps it's time to learn a new editor... Why Not Emacs?

Emacs Club is a new group at Penn whose goal will be to explore the
power of our favorite text editor. GNU Emacs is an extensible,
customizable text editor â€” and more. The ability to augment Emacs with
your own code snippets makes Emacs ideal for not only programming, but
also many other classes of situational editing, such as organization
or blogging.

Throughout the semester, we'll learn the basic and intermediate techniques of Emacs as a group, with a focus on topics dealing with personalization and customization.

Join us for our first beginner session tomorrow, Tuesday Feb 14th at
6pm in Levine 307, where we'll go over all the Emacs basics you need
to get started. To take full advantage of this session, you should
bring your Emacs equipped laptop. We can help you get it installed if
you have trouble. Pizza will be served!
