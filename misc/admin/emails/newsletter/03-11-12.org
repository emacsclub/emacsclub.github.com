Welcome back everyone! I hope you all had a pleasant break.

* Command of the Week

  ~C-l~ Center your cursor, then place it at the top or bottom of the screen by
  doing this twice more. Placing it at the top is handy if you are
  about to write a new function, class, etc.. At the bottom is useful
  if you need to reference something in your code directly above your
  cursor. 

* Meeting Today
  
  Today's Meeting will take place at 6pm as usual in the Skirkanich
  Skyview Lounge SKR 508. 

  We'll take a stab at some more of our emacs topics, including
  programming in C and setting up a sophisticated project management
  system for C/C++ projects. Please come with any topics you would
  like to discuss!
