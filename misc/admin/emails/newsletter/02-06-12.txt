                         Emacs Club this Week
                         ====================


Thanks everyone for coming out to last week's meeting. 

The meeting this week will be at a higher level of difficulty, 
and you might get a little lost if you don't yet know how to use 
emacs or haven't gone through the tutorial yet. 

We'll have a beginner meeting again next week where we'll go over 
some more basic stuff. 

Command of the Week 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  `C-c t' brings up the tutorial. You'll always find the basic key commands
  you need to remember on this page. A more modern emacs tutorial that is much
  easier to follow and better written can be found [here] and is highly 
  recommended.

Next Session (Intermediate Level) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The next emacsclub meeting will be on Tuesday Feb 7 at 6pm in Room ??.
  
  We'll be going through a few of the basic standard packages (plugins)
  that you can install for emacs, and a few other cool things that relate
  to the emacsclub website. If you've gone through a tutorial, you should
  be able to keep up with most of the things we cover in this session. We can
  always help you out if you get stuck!

  - The Emacs Starter Kit [https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit]
    A useful group of emacs packages that is bundled in an easy to use way. Very
    handy!

  - Getting started with Elnode [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Elnode]
    Elnode is an http server for emacs. We will host the emacsclub site with 
    elnode to demo its potential. 

  - Org Mode [http://orgmode.org/]
    The best organizational tool any programmer could ask for.
