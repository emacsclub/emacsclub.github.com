Meeting Notes 2012-11-13

* The Emacs Club C tutorial
  - Tomorrow
  - Mish needs a partner to teach -- Andrew volunteers
  - We'll package a starter .emacs that will do some basic C configuration
  - Time budget is an issue -- we want to introduce people to Emacs, but too much introductory material might prevent us from talking about specific things about C development in Emacs
    - Benjamin's plan: spend 15 minutes demonstrating Emacs basics through C development and then dive into more advanced features
  - Do we do it on Eniac:
    - Pros: this is what many 240 students (Windows users) have to use; it will force learning
    - Cons: we don't know what people come in knowing
  - Should we show them multiple windows? Yes, but in a simplified form
* GDB, Mountain Lion, and Emacs: The Final Countdown
  - Mountain Lion apparently breaks GDB in Emacs 24.
  - See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8336433/gdb-on-macosx-lion and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10221448/emacs-24-and-gdb-6-3-on-mac-os-lion
* Using emacsclient as a collaborative editing tool
  - Building the .emacs for the C tutorial
  - Surprisingly, it doesn't work very well
  -
